    00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
    [Sonic] Woo-hoo! And cut! Let the story begin.
    
    00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
    [Storm] Boss!
    
    00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.555
    [Jet] OW!
    
    00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:01.330
    [Storm] We're in trouble, sir!
    
    00:01:02.555 --> 00:01:05.330
    [Wave] Storm. At least learn to knock when you enter a room.
    
    00:01:09.555 --> 00:01:11.330
    [Storm] What's this?!
    
    00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:15.330
    Huh? Could this be?!
    
    00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:18.330
    [Jet] Yeah, it's what I inherited from my grandpa.
    
    00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.330
    [Wave] Could this be the key to the legendary Babylon Garden, then?
    
    00:01:22.555 --> 00:01:27.330
    [Storm] Legend says some unbelievable treasure was hidden by our ancestors long ago.
    
    00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.330
    Right, right, right?
    
    00:01:33.555 --> 00:01:36.555
    Nuh-uh! If I hand it over to some mech-fanatic like you,
    
    00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:40.555
    you're totally gonna use it for some weird experiment, right?
    
    00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:42.555
    [Wave] Oh, come on! I'll give it back!
    
    00:01:43.555 --> 00:01:46.555
    [Storm] You know how many times you've already SAID you're gonna give it back?
    
    00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:53.555
    I'm TIRED of all this! Like our ancestors' teachings, only ask three wishes in a lifetime-
    
    00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:54.555
    [Jet] Oh, SHUT UP!
    
    00:01:56.555 --> 00:01:57.555
    So, what'd you want?!
    
    00:01:57.555 --> 00:02:01.555
    [Storm] Uh, it's about Ee-e-eeeee....
    
    00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:03.555
    [Wave] A guy called Eggman has business with us-
    
    00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:03.555
    OH!-
    [Storm] He said he has business with you and that he came aboard on our shiiiip!-
    
    00:02:09.555 --> 00:02:10.555
    [Wave] Hey, CUT IT OUT Storm!
    
    00:02:13.555 --> 00:02:16.555
    [Eggman] My, my, am I interrupting something?!
    
    00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:19.555
    [Jet] Oh!, it's you, huh?, the guy who wants to talk to me.
    
    00:02:19.555 --> 00:02:22.555
    [Eggman] Are you Master Jet, the one said to be the legendary rogue?!
    
    00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.555
    I always hear of your actions.
    
    00:02:27.555 --> 00:02:29.555
    [Jet] Enough with the flattery! What do you want?
    
    00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:36.555
    [Eggman] I've heard rumors that you have what is said to be the Babylon Garden key, the legendary of course!
    
    00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:40.555
    [Jet] Hey! What's this... key?
    
    00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:47.555
    [Eggman] You don't have to be so vigilant, I am on your side. Why would I not?
    
    00:02:47.555 --> 00:02:52.555
    Did you know the Babylon Garden's key is... (whispers unintelligible gibberish)
    
    00:02:54.555 --> 00:03:00.555
    [Jet] I see! The point is, we have to collect these... Chaos Emeralds, right?, Eggman, sir?
    
    00:03:01.555 --> 00:03:03.555
    That's easy-peasy!
    
    00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:05.555
    [Eggman] Is it really easy-peasy?
    
    00:03:05.777 --> 00:03:11.555
    [Jet] What do you mean?! Is there something us Babylon Rogues can't steal or what?!
    
    00:03:12.777 --> 00:03:11.555
    [Eggman] No, no! Do you know of this individual, though? He's called Sonic and he's said to be the fastest one on Earth.
    
    00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:24.555
    I've had several failures with this idiotic pest.
    
    00:03:24.777 --> 00:03:31.555
    [Jet] Hmph! I don't know about this fastest guy on Earth or whatever, but as long as I have this Extreme Gear with me,
    
    00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:32.555
    he's just a joke!
    
    00:03:40.777 --> 00:03:43.555
    [Tails] The signal's coming from around here!
    
    00:03:48.777 --> 00:03:52.555
    That's odd. It looks like some jamming waves are coming from somewhere.
    
    00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:55.555
    (Glass breaks loudly)
    [Sonic, Tails, Knuckles] Huh?!
    
    00:03:56.777 --> 00:03:58.555
    [Knuckles] What's that?!
    
    00:04:00.777 --> 00:04:03.555
    [Tails] Sonic! The emerald's over there!
    
    00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:12.519
    [Sonic] Alright, things are looking good here.
    
    00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.400
    [Knuckles] Shoot.
    
    00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.280
    [Sonic] Heh.
    
    00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:16.080
    [Jet] Too easy!
    
    00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.840
    [Sonic] What the...?
    
    00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.960
    [Jet] For the fastest guy in the world, you're nothing. Nothing at all.
    
    00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.919
    [Sonic] It's been a while since things have been this fired up!
    
    00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.080
    [Eggman] Ladies and gentlemen of the world, long time no see!
    
    00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.759
    My, my, you all seem to look bored, yes you do.
    
    00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:03.360
    I have the best present for such bored individuals, yes I do.
    
    00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.720
    It's called the EX-World Grand Prix, a race to see who's the fastest in the world.
    
    00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.639
    However, it's not just to decide who's the fastest in the world.
    
    00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:18.160
    This time, the race will be an earnest battle with no rules.
    
    00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:25.199
    Participants bring the Chaos Emeralds, and whoever wins in the end can take them all in one fell swoop.
    
    00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:35.240
    I'll be waiting for those who have confidence in their abilities to do this challenge.
    
    00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.880
    [Sonic] That blasted Eggman. Yeah, he must be up to something again. One more thing—
    
    00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.080
    [Eggman] Now... yes, yes, yes.
    
    00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:49.800
    Here are the guys who have decided to participate so far.
    
    00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.000
    [Sonic] That's him!
    ~For the fastest guy in the world, you're nothing. Nothing at all.~
    
    00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.360
    A battle to decide who's the fastest in the world... looks like fun.
    
    00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:10.800
    I'll get you back sooner or later.
    
    00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.720
    [Knuckles] Still, what exactly is Eggman planning anyway?
    
    00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:21.360
    [Sonic] Knuckles, I doubt it's anything important.
    
    00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:32.880
    I see you've signed up too, eh?
    
    00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.080
    Let me just not listen—this will fix the problem.
    
    00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.039
    Perfect, I don't want to go in with all this lovey-lovey stuff.
    
    00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:45.080
    Hey, Tails.
    
    00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.400
    [Tails] Mmm... That mark...
    
    00:07:49.199 --> 00:07:52.560
    [Sonic] Mark?
    
    00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:56.960
    Yeah, the board symbol of those guys we encountered in Future City last time, remember?
    
    00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:58.120
    [Tails] Babylon...
    
    00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.160
    [Sonic, Knuckles, Amy] Babylon?
    
    00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.800
    [Tails] Yeah, the Babylon Rogues!
    
    00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:07.800
    A long time ago, there was an island floating in the sky called the Babylon Garden.
    
    00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.800
    The rogues I was talking about lived there...
    
    00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:18.800
    According to the legend, once upon a time, there was a gang of thieves called the Babylon Rogues.
    
    00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:27.160
    All of the Babylonians lived on the Babylon Garden, but they provoked the gods' wrath with their excessive stealing,
    
    00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:30.800
    and the Babylon Garden got submerged deep underground.
    
    00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.800
    Since then, the Babylonians fell apart and never returned.
    
    00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:40.800
    But it is said there's still treasure they left in the Babylon Garden, somewhere...
    
    00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:40.800
    It's also said that each of the Babylonians were Extreme Gear specialists!
    
    00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.160
    [Knuckles] But how could something like the Babylon Garden be able to float?
    
    00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.800
    [Tails] About that...
    
    00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.800
    I used the results I got from analyzing the flow of the infinite backwards-inspection service and the viscus
    
    00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.160
    efficiency I saw determined by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem-
    
    00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.800
    [Knuckles] STOP!!!
    
    00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:05.800
    I got it, so I guess it basically floats through will-power then...
    
    00:09:06.160 --> 00:09:08.800
    (Wave laughs)
    
    00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.800
    [Wave] I'm sorry, but it's just too funny, y'know.
    
    00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:14.800
    (sarcastically) Oh! This gear sure is unusual.
    
    00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.800
    [Tails] Thanks! I set this gear up myself!
    
    00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:25.160
    [Wave sarcastically] Oh! Really?!
    ~Let me put this bomb on this stupid gear. They'll lose before you know it. Heh-heh.~
    
    00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.000
    (Wave laughs loudly and meanly)
    
    00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:37.800
    I'm sorry, but I can't believe someone would participate with such terrible gear!
    (Wave laughs loudly and meanly again)
    
    00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.160
    Thanks. You showed me something to laugh at. Heh-heh. See ya later, shorty!
    
    00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:48.800
    [Amy] What's up with her! She's disgusting! Oh!!!
    
    00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.160
    [Sonic] Right! She made Tails look like a big, fat idiot!
    
    00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.800
    [Knuckles] Yeah, and Tails' mecha knowledge is really good, too!
    
    00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:00.800
    [Tails] Grrrrr.......
    
    00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:00.800
    [Omochao] The next race is about to begin. All participants, please hurry to the gate.
    
    00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.800
    (Knuckles and Storm run into each other)
    
    00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.800
    [Knuckles] It's you!
    
    00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:19.800
    [Storm] You sure got me good the other day...
    
    00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:24.800
    [Knuckles] Hmph! I let you get away last time but I'm not gonna lose to you this time!
    
    00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:19.800
    [Storm] In this race, I'm gonna multiply the pain you gave me by 10, jerk!
    
    00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.800
    (Knuckles gasps)
    [Knuckles] Woah! I'm sorry!
    
    00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:42.160
    (Storm laughs)
    [Storm] Heh! What do you think you're doing?! This is how you punch knucklehead, yeah!
    
    00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:43.800
    [Knuckles] You're gonna attack?!
    
    00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:52.800
    [Storm] Sorry, I didn't think I'd get ambushed out here by some, some, SOME idiot.
    
    00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.160
    Woaaaahh!
    
    00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.800
    [Knuckles] You!
    
    00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.800
    [Omochao] The race begins soon. All participants who aren't there should come immediately.
    
    00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.160
    [Knuckles] If that's how it's gonna go, we're gonna settle this at the race.
    
    00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.800
    [Storm] I'll take you on!
    
    00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:23.160
    [Omochao] The semi-finals will be held in 10 minutes. Please gather at the gate when the time comes.
    
    00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.800
    [Sonic] Oh, yeah!
    
    00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:26.800
    [Tails] Sonic, that was amazing! When did you learn that trick?
    
    00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:37.800
    [Jet] Is this the fastest guy on Earth?!
    
    00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:45.800
    [Sonic] That's...
    [Jet] You have that much skill? Hmph! If you run on the ground you may be fast,
    
    00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:52.800
    but with Extreme Gear, it's a totally different story, which of course, you're too dumb to understand.
    
    00:11:53.160 --> 00:12:05.800
    You have to be one with the wind along with your gear. You can't do that like this.
    So you might as well kiss the ground and say goodbye.
    
    00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.800
    [Knuckles] What's with him?!
    
    00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:19.160
    [Sonic] Don't know, but his confidence isn't a lie, he's got confidence, alright.
    So I don't even know if I can win.
    
    00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:27.800
    ~I'm sorry, but I can't believe someone would participate with such terrible gear!~
    (Tails mentally sighs)
    
    00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:34.800
    [Tails] Sonic, I haven't gotten 100% efficiency out of the boards yet.
    I have to unlock the secret!
    
    00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:34.800
    [Sonic] Hey, Tails!, it's not your fault!
    
    00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:43.800
    [Tails] No... but as much as I hate to admit it, our opponent's mechanics are better than ours!
    
    00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:50.800
    Sonic, I'm gonna improve your board so we'll win the finals!
    
    00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:50.800
    [Storm] Boss!!! I'm so sorry to keep you waiting, sir!
    
    00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.800
    [Jet] Did you get anything?!
    
    00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000
    [Storm] Yeah, here you go, boss!
    
    00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.000
    [Wave] Give that to me.
    
    00:13:18.010 --> 00:13:20.000
    Hmm? What's this?
    
    00:13:20.010 --> 00:13:22.000
    [Jet] What's up, guys?
    
    00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.500
    [Storm] Regarding the treasure of Babylon...
    
    00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.500
    this looks a lot like Dr. Eggman's diary!
    
    00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:34.500
    (Jet clears his throat)
    
    00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:42.500
    "Hehehe... this worked out really great," (Jet's voice transforms into Eggman's thoughts) ~as it seems those stupid birds think
    the treasure of Babylon is a gem or something...~
    
    00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:50.500
    ~What fools! The Babylonians possessed the greatest technology in ancient times, and the treasure of Babylon is the fruit of that technology~
    
    00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:58.500
    ~It is said that a boy who made friends with the Babylonians was given a prototype of it, and it's believed he said he's obtained the wings of god.~
    
    00:14:00.010 --> 00:14:05.500
    ~And then apparently he ruled the world by using that power. This is something that can conquer the world at a prototype stage,~
    
    00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:11.500
    ~and I look forward to finding out exactly what is hidden there! Muhahahaha!~
    
    00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:15.500
    [Storm] So I guess it's not a gem after all, right? (Jet sighs)
    
    00:14:16.010 --> 00:14:26.500
    [Jet] I'm done, and I'm terribly mad at Eggman, but we are rogues after all, and, we're not interested in world domination or technology!
    
    00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:30.010
    [Wave] Master, there's something you need to know.
    
    00:14:30.010 --> 00:14:40.010
    Eggman may not look like it, but he is a genius with an IQ of 300. And that technology he's desperate to get must have considerable value, Master Jet.
    
    00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.500
    [Jet] So you mean we can make money out of it?!
    
    00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:49.500
    [Wave] It may be so valuable that it could be worth more than gold or silver gems!
    
    00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.500
    (Wave's alarm rings)
    
    00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.500
    [Jet] I was finally starting to feel good and laugh and you had to come in and spoil it!
    
    00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:04.010
    [Wave] Jet, it seems that it is time for the race to begin.
    
    00:15:04.010 --> 00:15:12.500
    [Jet] Alright! I'll knock 'em all down and get the treasure of Babylon, you see?!
    
    00:15:14.010 --> 00:15:23.500
    [Eggman] Like I said before, the race is an earnest battle with no rules! No matter what methods are used, whoever gets to the goal first is the winner.
    
    00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:32.500
    And said winner gets all of the Chaos Emeralds!
    
    00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:41.500
    [Jet] Heh! So you got to the finals with that fighting spirit you have, eh? Am I right?
    
    00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.500
    [Sonic] I won't lose this time!
    
    00:15:47.010 --> 00:15:54.500
    (Eggman laughs)
    [Eggman] With that said, it is time for the final race to begin! FINALLY!
    
    00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:13.500
    [Jet] ~We lost all of the races, well, until now. I better cheat to win if I have to! Now!~
    
    00:16:24.010 --> 00:16:33.500
    [Wave] ~The bomb I put on that gear previously will make Sonic's board explode. And we will finally win! Haha.~
    
    00:16:53.010 --> 00:16:56.500
    [Jet] Ha! I guess the ground suits you best.
    
    00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:01.500
    [Sonic] Grrrrrrr....
    
    00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:17.500
    [Jet] ~Sonic lost! Haha!~
    
    00:17:18.010 --> 00:17:20.500
    Hehehe!
    
    00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:48.500
    ~I wonder what'll happen. Well, let's see...~
    
    00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:31.010
    This is... the Babylon Garden!
    
    00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:33.500
    (Eggman laughs)
    
    00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:37.010
    [Eggman] I'll get the treasure of Babylon!
    
    00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:40.500
    [Amy] This is bad!
    
    00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:48.010
    [Jet] Eggman!!!
    
    00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:53.500
    [Sonic] Tails, Knuckles! We're going after him!
    
    00:18:54.010 --> 00:18:53.500
    [Knuckles] Wait up!
    (Tails pants)
    
    00:18:55.010 --> 00:19:04.010
    [Omochao] Special news, ladies and gentlemen! A mysterious flying object appeared above the venue where the EX World Grand Prix finals were being held!
    
    00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:14.500
    It seems that Sonic and his friends headed into that flying object to investigate, but we don't know the details! Could this object really be?...
    
    00:19:16.010 --> 00:19:20.010
    [Wave] Oh! I see that shorty and his friend came here too!
    
    00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:23.500
    [Knuckles] You wanna fight?!
    
    00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:32.500
    [Robot] .arget detected. Get them.
    
    00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:41.010
    [Tails] Knuckles! This isn't the time to fight right now!
    
    00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:48.500
    [Wave] You said something wise, for a shorty. Leave that thing alone and let's go, Storm!
    
    00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.500
    [Knuckles] DID SHE SAY "THAT THING"?!!!!!
    
    00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:54.010
    GET BACK HERE!!!
    
    00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:56.500
    [Tails] Wait for me, Knuckles!
    
    00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:15.500
    [Sonic] Found him!
    
    00:20:19.010 --> 00:20:22.500
    [Tails] Wait up! Here's this!
    
    00:20:24.010 --> 00:20:27.500
    [Sonic] Woahhhhh-a...
    
    00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:31.500
    What's this?
    [Tails] This is special gear that I prepared for when something like this happened.
    
    00:20:33.010 --> 00:20:35.500
    [Sonic] Not bad, Tails! Thank you!
    
    00:20:45.010 --> 00:20:47.500
    You?
    
    00:20:53.010 --> 00:20:57.010
    [Jet] You can't catch up with him, so give up!
    
    00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:00.500
    [Sonic] We'll see about that!
    
    00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:07.500
    I'll show you a world of speed you've never experienced before!
    
    00:21:12.010 --> 00:21:17.010
    Even without wings, I can still become one with the wind!
    
    00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:19.500
    Right?
    
    00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:34.010
    Wait! Stop right there!
    
    00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:37.010
    [Eggman] Wait up! Look at this!
    
    00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:39.500
    [Sonic] No!
    
    00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:46.500
    [Eggman] That's it! Keep still like that, hedgehog!
    
    00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:49.500
    [Sonic] Now!
    
    00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:59.320
    Let's see if you can see through this wind.
    
    00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.720
    [Eggman] What?
    
    00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:07.840
    Where are you?
    [Sonic] I'm here.
    
    00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:10.840
    [Eggman] Oh.
    
    00:22:17.440 --> 00:22:21.440
    [Sonic] Here you go.
    [Jet] What?
    
    00:22:22.799 --> 00:22:28.640
    [Jet] Don't mess with me! I lost against you!
    Remember? So there's no reason for you to pity me!
    
    00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:35.200
    [Wave] What are you saying?
    They don't want it, so let's take it!
    
    00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:38.919
    Treasure is treasure.
    
    00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:50.159
    [Sonic] Well, I guess we should be going, right, Tails?
    
    00:22:50.159 --> 00:22:52.159
    [Tails] Uh-huh.
    [Amy] Sonic!
    
    00:22:52.159 --> 00:22:54.840
    [Sonic] Amy!!!
    
    00:22:56.159 --> 00:22:58.880
    AMY!!!
    
    00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.559
    I'm begging you, please stop this!!!
    
    00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:09.840
    [Wave] Come on.
    
    00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:21.320
    [Jet] All right, here goes.
    
    00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.320
    (Monster screams loudly)
    
    00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:55.320
    [Sonic] ~What the?!~
    
    00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:05.840
    Looks like something interesting is going on!
    
    00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.840
    (Monster screams loudly again)
    
    00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:29.880
    [Tails] Look, Sonic! The doors are closing!
    [Sonic] Let's hurry!
    
    00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:46.880
    [Monster] You fools!... who are going after the treasure!
    
    00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:50.000
    Who is this guy?
    
    00:24:54.480 --> 00:25:05.640
    [Entire cast except Eggman] Yeah! (Once a character)
    
    00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:09.760
    No!
    
    00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.200
    [Entire cast except Eggman] This is!—
    
    00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:19.320
    (Eggman laughs)
    [Eggman] I guess you were too ecstatic about the treasure to notice me!
    
    00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:21.279
    [Sonic] Eggman!
    
    00:25:21.279 --> 00:25:23.279
    [Eggman] Now hand over the treasure!
    
    00:25:23.279 --> 00:25:24.720
    (Everyone except Eggman laughs)
    
    00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:28.120
    [Eggman] What's so funny?! Hand over the treasure right now!
    
    00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:30.120
    [Jet] Here you go!
    
    00:25:32.799 --> 00:25:36.400
    (Eggman laughs)
    [Eggman] I finally obtained the treasure of Babylon!
    
    00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.440
    What's this?
    A piece of cloth?!
    
    00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:54.000
    What do we have here?
    "At last, we have completed this groundbreaking invention,"
    
    00:25:54.000 --> 00:26:02.559
    "As long as we have this, we will be able to fly without needing any heavy labor to do and live an easygoing life.
    STOLEN --- THE THIRTEENTH LEADER OF THE BABYLON ROGUES".
    
    00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.840
    This carpet's tender texture is out of this world!
    
    00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:13.840
    Only the Babylonians could create such an amazing thing.
    
    00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:22.559
    All the rich men in the world will surely want this carpet, they say.
    
    00:26:25.679 --> 00:26:35.880
    I can't believe this!
    I opened the World Grand Prix for this... thing?!
    
    00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:47.440
    [Tails] Huh, could this be?
    [Wave] Oh, not bad! Looks like you noticed it too, shorty.
    
    00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:50.880
    [Sonic] Hey! What do you mean?
    [Wave] This is no ordinary carpet.
    
    00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.960
    [Tails] Uh-huh! Check out its material!
    It's the same stuff that the Extreme Gears use!
    
    00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.960
    [Jet] What'd you say?!
    
    00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:07.640
    [Sonic] Could that be?
    
    00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.080
    [Wave] It's likely that this is a prototype gear!
    
    00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:24.440
    [Sonic] A magic carpet?! I thought that was just in fairy tales!
    [Jet] To think that our ancestors were the spirits that appeared in those legendary stories—cool!
    
    00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:35.120
    [Sonic] Are you sure you're not gonna stay?
    [Jet] Yeah, there was a sentence carved in the back of the carpet. It said, "We're inventing this to obtain the world's treasures."
    
    00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:43.360
    If I stay here, I can't face the ancestors. I can't.
    Besides that though, listen up, Sonic.
    
    00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.360
    You'd better prepare yourself. The next time you appear before us, the Babylon Rogues.
    [Sonic] Gotcha!
    
    00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.559
    [Wave] Now then, Master Jet, we should get-
    [Storm] We should get going now, right?
    
    00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:06.200
    [Tails] We gotta get going too, right, Sonic?
    [Sonic] Yeah.

    I'll remember that.

    00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:07.760
    [Eggman] What? Just a puny carpet? (Groans)
    
    00:29:08.399 --> 00:29:14.799
    [Jet] I can't believe we could be descendants from genies. This is amazing!
    
    00:29:14.799 --> 00:29:19.360
    [Sonic] Oh, yeah.
    [Tails]And the technology in this is amazing too.
    
    00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.880
    [Jet] I guess we solved the mystery and finished everything.
    [Sonic] So, Jet.
    
    00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.919
    You're probably gonna be ready for the next round, right?
    
    00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:37.159
    [Jet] Am I ever! I won't give up.
    
    00:29:41.039 --> 00:29:45.679
    Also, my name is Jet the Hawk. What's your name?
    
    00:29:45.679 --> 00:29:49.679
    [Sonic] My name's Sonic the Hedgehog. Nice to meet you, Jet.
    
    00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:56.399
    [Sonic] I guess we're no longer rivals, right?
    
    00:29:56.399 --> 00:30:02.559
    [Jet] For now.
    I'll meet you in the next race, and you better be ready.
    
    00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:06.720
    Because I might just beat you next time.
    
    00:30:06.799 --> 00:30:11.840
    [Sonic] We'll see, yeah.
    Oh yeah!
    
    00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:14.880
    [Storm] Hey, knucklehead.
    
    00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.080
    I don't know why I keep calling you knucklehead, but
    let's let that slide. My name is Storm.
    
    00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:27.039
    The Albatross. What's your name?
    [Knuckles] Well, well, well.
    
    00:30:28.799 --> 00:30:33.919
    My name is Knuckles the Echidna, and it's pretty nice to meet you.
    
    00:30:33.919 --> 00:30:43.600
    [Wave] Yeah, yeah, yeah. Let's get this over with. It's just a friendly reunion. My name is Wave the Swallow. Nice to meet you, Tails.
    
    00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.960
    [Tails] Also, was my gear immature?
    
    00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.039
    [Wave] Well, it wasn't bad, but not like I'd expected.
    
    00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.760
    [Tails] While I improve my gear, you want to see it?
    
    00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:05.080
    [Wave] Yeah, some other time if I can.
    
    00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:12.960
    [Eggman] And my name is Dr. Eggman, everybody.
    [Entire cast except Eggman] WE KNOW THAT!
    
    00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:17.960
    [Jet] So we call him Egghead?
    [Sonic] Yeah, why not?
    
    00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.960
    [Most of the cast] Bye! (Multiple times)
    
    00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.000
    [Sonic] And again......, cut!
    
    00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.679
    Also, what Eggman did was basically escape.
    
    00:31:33.679 --> 00:31:36.679
    [Jet] It was a scheme?!
    
    00:31:36.679 --> 00:31:40.679
    (Jet angrily attacks Eggman)
    
    00:31:40.679 --> 00:31:46.720
    [Eggman] HELP! Please SOME HONESTY PLEASE!!! PLEEEEEAAAAAASSSSSEEEEEE!!!!
    
    00:31:47.679 --> 00:31:50.720
    Fine, I give up. It was a scheme after all.
