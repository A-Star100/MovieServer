​​<i><b>​ ​This...​ is Angel Island. ​</b></i>​

00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:12.030
​​<i><b>​ ​A mysterious place where a unique civilization used to live, the echidnas. ​</b></i>​

00:00:13.565 --> 00:00:15.866
​​<i><b>​ ​I'm the last of them anywhere in this galaxy, ​</b></i>​

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:21.000 
​​<i><b>​ ​And I watch over the Master Emerald, and any animals around the corner. ​</b></i>​

00:00:21.707 --> 00:00:28.344 
​​<i><b>​ ​But even though Angel Island sounds like an interesting place, it really isn't. ​</b></i>​

00:00:28.344 --> 00:00:31.115
​​<i><b>​ ​It's just plain grass, and some animals. ​</b></i>​

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.818 
​​<i><b>​ ​But I keep thinking about how things would be if the echidnas didn't die off. ​</b></i>

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.621 
​​<i><b>​ ​If I wasn't doing everything myself. ​</b></i>​

00:00:38.088 --> 00:00:41.994 
​​<i><b>​ ​And why didn't I die off with the rest of them? ​</b></i>​

00:00:41.994 --> 00:00:47.365 
​​<i><b>​ ​But... those questions probably won't be answered, right? ​</b></i>​

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:52.174 
​​<i><b>​ ​Long ago, my ancestors tried to take advantage of a power that didn't belong to them. ​</b></i>​

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:55.111 
​​<i><b>​ ​The Chaos Emeralds, and the Master Emerald. ​</b></i>​

00:00:55.982 --> 00:00:58.620 
​​<i><b>​ ​I became a guardian to prevent anything like that from happening ever again. ​</b></i>​

00:00:59.982 --> 00:01:01.620
​​<i><b>​ ​And I kept myself safe from all of the chaos. ​</b></i>​

00:01:02.391 --> 00:01:06.000 
​​<i><b>​ ​But who really made that power? The Chaos Emeralds, and the Master Emerald? ​</b></i>​

00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:08.428 
​​<i><b>​ ​And how did it become such a huge phenomenon? ​</b></i>​

00:01:08.491 --> 00:01:12.000 
​​<i><b>​ ​Who even built the altar the Master Emerald's in? ​</b></i>​

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:26.163 
​​<i><b>​ ​And where did the echidnas end up anyway? ​</b></i>​

00:01:26.428 --> 00:01:29.163 
​​<i><b>​ ​But I can't waste my time on these silly questions ​</b></i>​

00:01:29.428 --> 00:01:36.163 
​​<i><b>​ ​when I have a lot of other stuff to do, especially protect Angel Island. ​</b></i>​

00:02:02.239 --> 00:02:10.411 
<b>​ ​Hey bud, you need any help? I'm right here!  ​</b>

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.411 
<b>​ ​Hey, chill man! Chillax! ​</b>

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.411 
<b>​ ​So <i>this</i> is what you were looking for! ​</b>

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.411 
<b>​ ​This looks suspicious. Huh? ​</b>

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.411 
<b>​ These vines are extremely annoying! ​</b>

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:04.411 
<b>​ And what's this screwy little gear in my hand? ​</b>

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:08.411 
<b>​ Looks like it has something to do with this portal. ​</b>

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:35.411 
<b>​ What was that? ​</b>

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.411 
<b>​ What is this place? ​</b>

00:03:39.539 --> 00:03:46.411 
<b>​ Whoever's out there, come out of your hiding, cowards! </b>

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.000 
<b>​ Do you really think that you can ambush me? </b>

00:04:03.009 --> 00:04:07.000 
<b>​ Well, your funeral's gonna happen pretty soon! </b>

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.000 line:0
<b>​ Yaaaaaaah! </b> 

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.000 line:0
<b>​ Yaaaaaaahhh! </b> 

00:04:27.009 --> 00:04:28.000 line:0
<b>​ Hrrrgh! </b> 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.000 
<b>​ Whoever persecuted me by trapping me here, </b> 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.000 
<b>​ you'd better tell me how to get out of here, fast, </b> 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.000 
<b>​ or else I'll crush you, and any of your friends! </b>

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.000 
<b>​ Right now! </b> 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:09.000 
<b>​ Huh?! </b>

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:24.000 
<b>​ YAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!! </b>

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:24.000 line:0
<b>​ But I've realized on this journey that I do things my way, and I like it. </b> 

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:29.000 line:0
<b>​ But sometimes... it's the other way around. </b>

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:56.000 line:70
<b>​ <I>[Knuckles]</I> Why did <i>you</i> come around, Sonic? </b>

00:05:56.009 --> 00:05:59.000 line:70
<b>​ <I>[Sonic]</I> I literally came to another dimension. </b>

00:05:59.009 --> 00:06:01.000 line:70
<b>​ Cut me some slack, Knucklehead. </b>

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:06.000 line:70
<b>​ Come on. We're gonna fly back to our dimension. </b>
