00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:05.805
Whoa!

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:07.240
Are you guys seeing this?

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.976
Looks like Shadow’s back. Impossible.

00:00:09.976 --> 00:00:11.811
What are you guys doing?

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.546
Well, I have one question.

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.415
What are you doing, man?

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.184
Don't ask <i>me</i> that. You're standing here.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.487
Try asking <i>yourself</i> for once.

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:21.855
Shadow, you're sillier than ever.

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.790
Now just let me ask you that question.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.892
<b>What in the world are you doing here, Shadow?!</b>

00:00:25.892 --> 00:00:29.295
Stop trying to make me angry. Run away.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:30.797
<b>Before you get hurt.</b>

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:33.733
Stand down. Shadow!

00:00:33.733 --> 00:00:35.468
We don't want to fight you.

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:38.471
Actually, Sonic, I would like to fight.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:38.996
Not now.

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:39.706 position:100% align:end
<i>Rrrgh...</i>


00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.641
Shadow, we can talk about this together

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.743
if you just came down from that
car already!

00:00:43.743 --> 00:00:46.613
You have the audacity to believe
I would do something like that?

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:48.515
You know,
you're pretty stupid for a team of three.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:50.417
Oh, all right, I've had enough with this guy!

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:54.821
<b>I will tear you to shreds!</b>

00:01:08.818 --> 00:01:10.821
Knuckles!


00:01:11.337 --> 00:01:13.073
Are you okay?

00:01:13.073 --> 00:01:15.408
No. Not really. No.

00:01:15.408 --> 00:01:17.377
Why would Shadow show up now?

00:01:17.377 --> 00:01:18.411
It doesn't make sense.

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:20.680
You know, this guy is a lot
more impressive than you, Sonic.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.683
Dude. I'm standing right here.

00:01:24.017 --> 00:01:24.751
But don't worry.

00:01:24.751 --> 00:01:26.622
He can't take all of us at once.

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:28.333 position:100% align:end
<i>Ow!</i>

00:01:28.623 --> 00:01:29.066 position:7% align:end
<i>Urgh!</i>

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:34.761
Can we just talk about this?

00:01:37.163 --> 00:01:38.131
Okay.

00:01:38.131 --> 00:01:40.266
He took us all at once.

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:43.269 position:100% align:end
<i><b>Weaklings...</b></i>

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:58.218
Wait a sec,
I thought we're going tubing today.

00:01:58.251 --> 00:02:00.353
Wait, is this a race?!

00:02:00.353 --> 00:02:02.288
And we're gonna beat ya!

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.058
And just take note that <i>I'm</i> going to be
the one to become speed champion,

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.392
you losers.

00:02:06.392 --> 00:02:07.227
Cute.

00:02:07.227 --> 00:02:09.329
You really think you can beat
the fastest thing alive?

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.332
Who's a world-renowned blue blur
who's been famous all over town?

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.102
Well then, don't be afraid
that you're about to <i>lose</i>!

00:02:16.102 --> 00:02:17.070
Well then, let's go!

00:02:19.772 --> 00:02:21.541
And to nobody's surprise, the

00:02:21.541 --> 00:02:24.844
star blue blur is ahead in the lead
and is gonna win this shebang!

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:26.813
<i>Truly the one and only.</i>

00:02:26.813 --> 00:02:29.816 line:0
<i>Come on, Sonic!</i>

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.352
What the what now!

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:34.521
You know, even <i>I'm</i> ahead of you, Sonic!

00:02:34.521 --> 00:02:36.222
Even Knuckles is ahead of me?

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:39.225
Time to light the afterburners.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:40.627
It’s a bird!

00:02:40.627 --> 00:02:42.061
It's a plane!

00:02:42.061 --> 00:02:45.031
It's Air Hedgehog!

00:02:57.443 --> 00:02:59.279
All right, all right.

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:00.146
<b>I did it!</b>
