00:00:11.114 --> 00:00:12.834
Sonic: What?!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.797
Shadow: It all starts with this…

00:00:19.114 --> 00:00:21.834
A miracle stone of infinite power…

00:00:22.114 --> 00:00:25.834
Sonic: That’s! - That's a chaos emerald!

00:00:29.114 --> 00:00:31.236
So you’re the one everybody’s talking about!

00:00:31.236 --> 00:00:34.834
The military went after me because they confused me for you!

00:00:34.834 --> 00:00:39.834
Now… that chaos emerald… just whaddya think you’re gonna do with it?!

00:00:39.834 --> 00:00:41.834
Say something!, you faker!

00:00:41.834 --> 00:00:44.834
Shadow: Chaos control!

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:01.834
Sonic: Tch! - That speed!

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:05.297
No - that’s not his true speed! - He's using the Chaos Emerald to warp!

00:01:05.297 --> 00:01:09.957
Shadow: My name is Shadow. 
I’m the sole ultimate lifeform on this planet…

00:01:09.297 --> 00:01:13.834
I must head back to where I came from -
- this game ends now!
Sonic: Gah!

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.834
His name is Shadow?

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.000
SOLDIERS: Stay where you are and put your hands above your head right now!
Sonic: Great…

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.100
11:56 AM, 11:56 AM, PRISON ISLAND: OFF THE COAST, IN THE SKY

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.000
Tails: This must be the Island!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.000
This is a super strong military base and prison!

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.000
It’s best known as Prison Island.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:44.000
I’ve heard all the news on Satellite TV, but… - I still can’t believe that Sonic would destroy military buildings or rob a bank…

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:47.000
Hold on, Sonic! I’ll get you outta there right away!

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:54.245
Huh? —— That’s Amy!… and isn’t that?!… Eggman?!

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.000
What’s Amy doing here?! —  Nuh-uh, doesn’t matter, I’ve gotta rescue (‘rescue') Amy, too!

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.000
Tornado! - Mode change!

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.000
Rouge: Long time no see! You have the rest of my emerald, don’t ya dear?

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.000
Knuckles: Enough of that! As if telling me to give it to YOU will do anything!

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.000
Rouge: All right… in that case… I’ll just —— force you to give them to me…

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.000
MINUTES BEFORE EGGMAN’S ATTACK - ONE MINUTE AND THIRTY SECONDS

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.000
Tails: Sonic… I did it…

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.000
Sonic on Walkie-Talkie: Awesome job Tails!

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.000
Tails: Sonic! — Amy: Hmm? Sonic on Walkie-Talkie: Look outside.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:11.000
The intruder is currently in the north area proceeding to infiltrate the underground base! - All units standby for further orders and deployment! - All units in the current area proceed with basic battle formations! - and prevent the intruder from accessing the restricted area!This is not a drill repeat, this is not a drill!

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:16.400
Eggman: Wahaahaa! This is too easy!

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:27.400
Let me see what my grandfather had made! ———— Let me see what this top-secret military weapon is!

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:28.400
Sonic: That’s!-

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.655
Shadow: It’s that hedgehog again of all places!-
Sonic: I found you!, faker!

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:44.100
Shadow: Faker? Aren’t YOU the fake one here? — No… you don’t even deserve to be called my fake… Are you even up to my level?

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.655
Sonic: I’ll make you eat those words!

00:04:49.400 --> 00:05:00.000
Sonic: You’re not gonna run away this time…. — You faker! -
Eggman: I finally blasted that pest of a hedgehog into outer space! Now then, what shall you do Tails?
Should you dare oppose me - I shall offer no mercy!

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:09.135
Tails: You’ll pay! - You’ll pay for what you did to Sonic! I won’t let you get away with this!

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:15.400
Knuckles: What are you doing!-Rouge: I’m returning them… - they stink like echidnas anyway…

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.400
Knuckles: Well - if you thought it that way… you should’ve returned them to me in the first place…

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.400
Finally…

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.400
Rouge: What?  —— Knuckles: I’m sorry… for acting roughly (for acting so rudely)…’

00:06:15.855 --> 00:06:17.400
Sonic: Now, Shadow!

00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:22.400
Sonic and Shadow in Unison: Chaos - Control! 

00:06:29.855 --> 00:06:34.400
Shadow: Maria… Is this what you wished for?…
