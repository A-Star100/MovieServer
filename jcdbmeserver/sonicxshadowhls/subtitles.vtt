00:00:13.767 --> 00:00:15.000
Hey dude!

00:00:16.001 --> 00:00:18.200
Out of an entire cast of people,

00:00:18.201 --> 00:00:21.999
it was you who came to me. 

00:00:22.201 --> 00:00:24.000
You have a little something I need...

00:00:24.201 --> 00:00:27.000
But the item isn't overdue yet, is it?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
But I'm on a date with it!

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:32.000
This is serious, Shadow!

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:36.500
Well then, it'll be a date to DIE for!

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:32.500
Sorry, Shadow! But this emerald's mine now!

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:39.000
Here. 

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:42.000
Sonic was too stupid to realize that I had hid

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.000
the real Chaos Emerald.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.500
Sonic: Cut! Great job, Shadow!

00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:55.500
Shadow: That was a bit more complicated than I thought.
